    About GLAM
  </h1>
  <p class="p17">

GLAM (GL And Markup) is a declarative language for creating 3D content for browsers. It

renders with WebGL, using the graphics power of Three.js. GLAM adds behaviors,

interaction and lots of easy­to­use features on top of Three.js, but most importantly, it

defines a markup language and set of stylesheet extensions that make 3D programming

a snap.

With GLAM, 3D authoring is like any other web authoring. To make 3D, you create

elements, set their attributes, add event listeners, and define styles. Just like DOM used

to make! Content is easy to animate: keyframes and tweens can be defined in a compact

set of markup tags, or as standard CSS3 animations or transitions. GLAM is also fully

extensible: to add custom behavior, write JavaScript event handlers. If you want fancy

shading written in GLSL, simply specify your vertex and fragment shaders as properties

of the object's style.

GLAM was created by Tony Parisi, the guy who made the Virtual Reality Markup

Language (VRML), 20 years before anybody knew they needed it. Since then, Tony's

learned a few more things about graphics, web browsers have grown up, and the world

has caught up with his vision. GLAM is still quite young. We're adding features and

demos at a rapid clip, and we are also looking closely at related technologies such as

Web Components as they come of age. We'd love your feedback and contributions!
