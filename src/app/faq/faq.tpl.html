    Why GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

GLAM (GL And Markup) is a declarative language for creating 3D content for browsers. It

renders with WebGL, using the graphics power of Three.js. GLAM adds behaviors,

interaction and lots of easy to use features on top of Three.js, but most importantly, it

defines a markup language and set of stylesheet extensions that make 3D programming

a snap.

With GLAM, 3D authoring is like any other web authoring. To make 3D, you create

elements, set their attributes, add event listeners, and define styles. Just like DOM used

to make! Content is easy to animate: keyframes and tweens can be defined in a compact

set of markup tags, or as standard CSS3 animations or transitions. GLAM is also fully

extensible: to add custom behavior, write JavaScript event handlers. If you want fancy

shading written in GLSL, simply specify your vertex and fragment shaders as properties

of the object's style.

GLAM was created by Tony Parisi, the guy who made the Virtual Reality Markup

Language (VRML), 20 years before anybody knew they needed it. Since then, Tony's

learned a few more things about graphics, web browsers have grown up, and the world

has caught up with his vision. GLAM is still quite young. We're adding features and

demos at a rapid clip, and we are also looking closely at related technologies such as

Web Components as they come of age. We'd love your feedback and contributions!

    Why Now?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

WebGL is ubiquitous. With the release of iOS8, WebGL now runs on all major desktop

and mobile browsers, across all devices. That's 3 billion seats ready for connected 3D

applications, everywhere, powered by JavaScript. This is an incredible opportunity to

change the face of computing.

The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in building WebGL. But there is a

huge skill gap. 3D is inherently hard, yes; we have that extra dimension to worry about,

plus cameras, shaders, skinned animations, etc... But there is no reason to make 3D

harder than it has to be. For the simple 3D stuff, there should be a simple way to do it,

with an approach that is familiar to the millions of web developers ready to try something

new. Until GLAM, this didn't exist. GLAM is here to make your 3D job easier, so you can

focus on the fun part: building a killer 3D web app.

    How Do I Use GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">


To add GLAM to your application, simply include either the debug or minified version of

the library:

&lt;script src="pathtoglam/glam.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

OR

&lt;script src="pathtoglamlib/glam.min.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

... and then you can start adding 3D tags to your page. To see what those tags look like,

read the Getting Started Tutorial (link)

    How Do I Author GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

Right now, authoring GLAM requires a text editor. Someday, maybe, we'll build an

interactive tool for authoring, or at least a syntax assisted in browser editor a la JSFiddle.

To test, you will most likely need a web server ... so that you can see your texture maps

and shaders. Launching HTML files from your Finder/Explorer usually results in the

browser yakking about crossÂ­origin restrictions.

How Can I Participate?

GLAM is new. We're just getting started, and we need your help! We are looking for help

with code, content and documentation. Check out the Github repo and examples (links

here) and join the GLAM revolution!
